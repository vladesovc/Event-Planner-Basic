# Event-Planner-Basic

A basic daily planner where you can save and change events for certain time slots through out the day. 

Description:
This Hourly Planner breaks down your day between 0900-1700 in order to help keep you organized. You are able to type text into the input boxes and click Save for you to stick with your plan. As events "expire" they will turn grey indicating it is past time, they will be red for present, indicating that this task is about to expire, and green for anything listed in the future.
